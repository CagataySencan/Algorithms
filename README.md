# Algorithms

In this repository, i am adding algortihms that i learned.

Current algorithms: 
  -Binary Search Algorithm (Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half).
  -Kadane's Algorithm (Kadane's Algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming algorithm. It calculates the maximum sum subarray ending at a particular position by using    the maximum sum subarray ending at the previous position).
